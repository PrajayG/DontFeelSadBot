# DontFeelSadBot
@DontFeelSadBot - A twitter bot aimed at cheering people up. 


This is a bot that you can check out at https://twitter.com/dontfeelsadbot 

I came upon the idea to make this bot after seeing the amount of abuse that gets thrown around on Twitter. Every 15 minutes it searches Twitter for phrases like 'I'm feeling down/sad' and tweets a short motivational phrase back at those people. It was a relatively quick and easy process to make the bot, but after running for a while it has got over a thousand followers and I regularly get sent lovely messages from people who have had their day made by it. 

I used the making of the bot to get familiar with the Tweepy API which is super easy to use. If you want to use the bot, grab the repo, make a Twitter account and put your keys in the two files provided.
